/**
 * @file main.c
 * @author Seongbin Kim (seongbin10209@gmail.com)
 * @brief This code is used to test functions with implications from the preprocessor of gcc.
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2023-02-15
 * 
 * Note:
 * The C preprocessor, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program.
 * The transformation occurs before compilation.
 * It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros,
 * which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs. 
 * 
 * This file covers the following topics of the C preprocessor:
 * Header Files 	- #include
 * Macros			- #define
 * Conditionals	    - #ifdef
 * Et cetera
 * 
 * Check official manuals for detailed descriptions:
 * @link https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 	step(1). $ g++ -E main.cpp > main.i
 *  - This redirects the output of the preprocessed main.cpp to the main.i file.
 *      - More about output redirection: @link https://www.guru99.com/linux-redirection.html
 *  - Take a screenshot of the contents of main.i
 *      - $ cat main.i
 *          - To view the contents.
 * 
 *  step(2). g++ -o filename main.cpp
 *  - To create an executable file with a desirable name.
 * 	- Then follow the instructions printed!
 * 	- Have fun!
 * 
 * God is good, all the time!
 * Happy Coding~~

    /*
    The parts of code that have been commented out in main.cpp are not included during preprocessing. 
    During the preprocessing phase, Header files are included, macros are replaced, and comments are removed, and codes like '#endif' are removed too. 
    The preprocessing process involves extracting parts of code necessary for execution from the code written by the programmer and consolidating them into a single source code. 
    Consequently, codes like comments that do not have a direct impact on code execution are excluded.
